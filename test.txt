Cats have a high breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, 
a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering and the abandonment of former 
household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.[8] 
This has led to extinction of many bird species.
